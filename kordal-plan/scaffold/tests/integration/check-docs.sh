#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Documentation checks, part of `make lint`. For every Markdown file of the
# repository (tracked, or new and not ignored):
#
#   - every relative link points to a file that exists and that Git does not
#     ignore (an ignored file would be missing from a clone);
#   - a link with an anchor to a Markdown file names a heading of that file,
#     and a bare #anchor a heading of its own file;
#   - a reference link, [text][label] or [label][], names a label that the
#     same file defines.
#
# The targets checked are those of an inline link or image, [text](target),
# and of a reference definition written on one line, "[label]: target": the
# target optionally in <angle brackets>, with or without a title. A "?query"
# is dropped, and a target that starts with "/" is read from the repository
# root. A link that leads out of the repository, any "scheme:" and "//host",
# is not fetched.
#
# Not read, for links, references or headings:
#   - a fenced code block: from a line of three or more backticks or tildes,
#     with or without an info string, to a line of the same character at least
#     as long, or to the end of the file. A fence may be indented and stand
#     behind a block-quote or list marker: then the block ends with that quote
#     or list item at the latest;
#   - an HTML comment (the scaffold's placeholders are comments), up to its
#     "-->". Without one, "<!--" is text and hides nothing;
#   - a code span of one or more backticks, which may wrap inside its paragraph.
# Not checked either: a path named in running text, and a shortcut reference,
# [text] alone, which is also what a task-list checkbox and a footnote look
# like.
#
# This is not a Markdown parser: an indented code block reads as prose, only
# "#" headings give anchors, a table row is known by its leading pipe, a
# fenced block in a list item inside a quote ends with the quote, and a
# definition spread over several lines counts as defined without its target
# being checked. Two bracket pairs in a row are read as a reference only in a
# file that defines a label at all, and not behind a letter, a digit, "]" or
# ")", where they index: rows[0][1]. Where such a file means no link by them,
# as in "cmd [options][file]", they go in a code span or behind a backslash,
# "\[".
#
# Needs git and a local Node.js: `make lint` skips it, saying so, when there is
# none. The task gate (`make task-check`) fails without Node.js all the same,
# at its structure-check stage. The tests of this script,
# scripts/check-docs.test.mjs, belong to `make agent-check`, which is no stage
# of the task gate: `node scripts/agent-local.mjs gate` runs it when the branch
# changes the agent tooling, and the hosted Agent structure workflow runs it on
# the pull request.
